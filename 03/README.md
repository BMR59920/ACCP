# Section 03 : What is Cloud Computing?
## Lesson 07 : IT Overview

Client + IP Addr ---- Network ---- Server + IP Addr

This is equivalent to traditional postal service. The letter being the content and the address being the destination Server / IP Addr

## Lesson 08 : Cloud Computing

Deployment models : Private, Public, and Hybrid

### Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
- On Demand  
- Broad Network Access
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling 
- Rapid Elasticity and Scalability
- Measured Service

### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing:
- Trades CAPEX for OPEX : Reduce TCO and OPEX  
- Economies of Scale 
- Capacity and Scale based on usage 
- Increased Speed and Agility 
- Cost associated with running your own Data Center 
- Leverage global infrastructure

### Problems Solved:  
- Flexibility  
- Cost-Effectiveness   
- Scalability  
- Elasticity  
- High-Availability  
- Agility  

## Lesson 09 : Different Types

### Infrasrtucture as a Service (IaaS)
- Provide building blocks for cloud IT  
- Provide networking, compute, storage  
- High flexibility  
- Parallel with on-premise IT

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure  
- Focus on deployment and management of applications

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Completed product that is run abd managed by the service provider  

### Different variants requre different management  
With on-prem you manage everything. Apps, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking  

*IaaS* you manage Apps, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS - Think EC2  

*PaaS* you manage Apps and Data - Think Elastic Beanstalk   

*SaaS* is all managed by others - Many services like Zoom, Gmail, etc

### Pricing : Pay as you go
- Compute - you pay for the running instance  
- Storage - you pay for the data stored  
- Network - you only pay for the data out  

## Lesson 10 : AWS Overview

AWS launched internally in 2002.

Use Cases : Enterprise IT, backup & storage, Big Data analytics, Hosting, Mobile, Social Apps, Gaming.

AWS Global Infastructure : Regions, Availability Zones, Data Centers, Edge Locations / Points of Presence.

Chosing a Region :  
- Compliance, data governance and legal requirements.  
- Proximity for reduced latency.  
- Available services.  
- Pricing varies region to region.

Avaiability zones :
Most have 3 AZs but can have up to six. Each AZ is separated from each other so they are isolated from disasters. They are connected with high-bandwith, ultra-low latency networking.

Edge Locations:
AWS has 400+ POPs in 90 cities across 40 countries.

Global Services: IAM, R53, WAF, CloudFront.  Most AWS services are region scoped.  

## Lesson 11 : Console Updates

This is simply notice that the slides may look different than what is presented by AWS.

## Lesson 12 : Console Tour

## Lesson 13 : About the UI Changes

Instructor strives to make the content current to any new UI changes.

## Lesson 14 : Shared Responsibility

The shared respnsibility model defines what AWS is responsible for and what the user is responsible for.  

User is responsible for Security, Data, OS, IAM, Encryption, Network,

AWS is reponsible for the hardware and *their* software.  

User cannot: Illegal, Harmful, Offensive use or Content. No Security Violations. No Network Abuse. No EMail or Message Abuse
